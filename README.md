# DAG Builder ‚Äì React Flow Editor

A modern, interactive Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) editor built with React and React Flow. This tool allows users to create, connect, validate, and auto-layout nodes visually with full drag-and-drop support.

## Libraries Used

| Library       | Purpose                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `react-flow`  | Visual editor for node graphs                  |
| `dagre`       | Auto-layout algorithm for directed graphs      |
| `uuid`        | Unique IDs for node creation                   |
| `react-icons` | Clean icon rendering (e.g., status indicators) |

## Design Decisions

CustomNode Component: Built to support ports (source/target) and easily styled.
Position Handling: Nodes are placed in random visible coordinates within bounds to avoid overlap.
Auto Layout: Implemented with `dagre` to create clean top-down layouts when the graph becomes messy.
Validation: Enforces valid DAG rules ‚Äî no cycles, minimum 2 nodes, all connected.
Reusability: Modular buttons (`AddNode`, `DeleteNode`, `AutoLayout`) are reusable and styled consistently.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Node Positioning

Ensuring randomly added nodes don‚Äôt overlap or appear off-screen required using `getBoundingClientRect()` and `useReactFlow().project()` to position nodes within visible canvas.

### 2. Auto Layout

`dagre` requires transforming React Flow nodes and edges into its internal graph representation and back. Managing layout logic with dynamic updates while avoiding node flickers or broken connections was challenging.

### 3. State Management

Maintaining the correctness of nodes and edges using React Flow‚Äôs hooks (`useNodesState`, `useEdgesState`) was critical to avoid visual or logic bugs.

### 4. Validation

DAG validation had to handle:

* Cycles
* Unconnected nodes
* Self-loop prevention

Debugging the `validateDag` DFS cycle detection logic was a key task.

### 5. Blank Screen Bugs

Initially using `useReactFlow` without placing the component inside a `ReactFlowProvider` led to runtime errors. Fixing provider hierarchy resolved rendering issues.
